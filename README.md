- A Next-Generation Astronomy Learning Platform at Your Fingertips
- ü•â 2nd Runner-Up Award, National Software Contest 2023 (NSC2023), Educational Software Category

## Overview
Although astronomy is included in the Thai science education curriculum, it is often overlooked due to its complexity and outdated, unengaging teaching materials. ‚ÄúAstrodemy‚Äù, a blend of ‚ÄúAstronomy‚Äù and ‚ÄúAcademy,‚Äù is a platform that makes astronomy content easily accessible and interactive for the general public through digital screens. Astrodemy provide features:
1. **3D Simulation**:
    - Solar System: Interactive 3D model of the solar system, allowing users to observe planetary orbits, rotations, and read information of those planets.
    - Moon Phase: Visualize the moon's phases in an interactive format, showing how its appearance changes throughout the lunar cycle with explanations of each phase.
    - Sun Life Cycle: Show the sun‚Äôs life stages from its beginning to end, all presented through a dynamic 3D simulation.
2. **Online Multiplayer Game and Quiz**:
    - Drawing Guessing: Players take turns drawing astronomy-related objects or concepts (like planets, stars, or constellations) while others guess what they are in a fun and interactive environment.
    - Re-sort Picture: Rearrange scrambled images of space objects or space into their correct order to test and enhance visual recognition and knowledge of astronomy.
3. **Astronomy Blog**: Share and explore astronomy-related posts, fostering knowledge exchange and community interaction.
4. **Astronomy Event Notification**: Receive timely updates on celestial events like meteor showers and eclipses directly to your device.
5. **Astronomy Education Tools for Teachers**: Tools for creating interactive lesson plans and resources such as Interactive 3D Simulation, to inspire students in astronomy.
